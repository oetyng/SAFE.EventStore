# SAFE.EventStore
EventSourcing database on SAFE Network

Based on examples in MaidSafe's mobile repo (https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_mobile).
Uses the csharp bindings (https://github.com/krishnaIndia/safe_app_csharp/tree/new_bindings).

Not configured for alpha-2 network anymore, since latest SAFENetwork csharp bindings are now used.

To start using event sourcing as a database solution - for parts of, or entire applications - reference the SAFE.EventStore library in 
your .NET project, and have a simple solution for storing and retrieving data as events in streams.
Todo: Graphical UI for the DB management.

Storing with mock routing SAFE network can be tried with the NoteBook example.
